#+TITLE: Emacs Guix Environment
* Emacs Profile
* Keep .emacs.d Clean

I don't want a bunch of transient files showing up as untracked in the Git repo so I move them all to another location.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; Change the user-emacs-directory to keep unwanted things out of ~/.emacs.d
  (setq user-emacs-directory (expand-file-name "~/.cache/emacs/")
        url-history-file (expand-file-name "url/history" user-emacs-directory))

  ;; Use no-littering to automatically set common paths to the new user-emacs-directory
  (use-package no-littering)

  ;; Keep customization settings in a temporary file (thanks Ambrevar!)
  (setq custom-file
        (if (boundp 'server-socket-dir)
            (expand-file-name "custom.el" server-socket-dir)
          (expand-file-name (format "emacs-custom-%s.el" (user-uid)) temporary-file-directory)))
  (load custom-file t)

* Desktop Environment

Load up the desktop environment if on a machine that supports it and the =--use-exwm= argument was passed to Emacs on startup.  Desktop environment and window management code can be found in Desktop.org.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (setq dw/exwm-enabled (and (not dw/is-termux)
                             (eq window-system 'x)
                             (seq-contains command-line-args "--use-exwm")))

  (when dw/exwm-enabled
    (require 'dw-desktop))

#+end_src

*Guix Packages*

Despite the code being in Desktop.org, include the emacs packages for the desktop environment in this file so that they can be included in the Emacs profile.

#+begin_src scheme :noweb-ref packages :noweb-sep ""

  "emacs-exwm"
  "emacs-desktop-environment"

*** Emojis in buffers
